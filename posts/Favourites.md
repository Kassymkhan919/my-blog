# I want to share my things that I like
### These are YouTube channels of creators that I like, articles. Something like online haul (>‿◠)✌

# Youtube Channels:
- [해그린달 haegreendal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCazay-C-shtEEUO78ObKGJg) - is very peaceful and thoughtful channel. I really like how creator films the scenes and I understand how much time and effort it takes to film everything she does. Very good content.
- [Lofi 코딩](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LIt_ICJyjk&t=1s) - I like this lofi channel because it is similar to many others but still something catches my attention to it and I can't understand what specifically it is. 
- [수린 suzlnne](https://www.youtube.com/c/%EC%88%98%EB%A6%B0suzlnne/) - I like the visuals of this channel. It is similar to the first channel but it is about young lady who finishes university in Korea and I like the vibe and aesthetics here.

### That's it for today. I will add some more channels later.
